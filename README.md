# Why TidyWeek?

We thought it best to have a program name that:

1. Follows major themes in the `tidyverse` and R4DS, tidy data and tidy tools!
2. Reflects the target duration of most projects
3. Relatively easy to remember twitter hashtag (#TidyWeek)

# What is Tidy data? Tidy tools?  Tidyverse?

It is a framework and theory by Hadley Wickham that has grown from its humble origins and expanded to [data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), [tools](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and workflows for [working in data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

# TidyWeek Project Outline
- Regular/weekly projects as output of the mentor-learner partnership during a week 
- Each week a data set will be published (via https://data.world and separate repo with instructions here), this weeks/test here (later will create R4DS profile there +add admins): https://data.world/radovankavicky/2018-01-tidyweek
- Learners will create profile there and a project (we will use `data.world` R package, more @ CRAN here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.world/index.html), which automatically generates and RMd notebook that will later be published on GitHub 
- Train & walk-through full Data Science cycle/process capturing transformation from raw, messy real-world dataset into tidy form and the output/model, visualization or final document/published via Data.World or as Jupyter notebook with IRkernel via GitHub
- More on #MakeoverMonday here (for those that are not yet familiar with it): http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk
- Share your work via Twitter and other social networks with #TidyWeek (as for the name & hashtag of the project + TidyWeek also because the learners will have to “tidy” the messy/real-world dataset first and will have a week to create the output from the given dataset via RPubs document or a Jupyter notebook published on GitHub with the help/oversight of the mentor) 
- Others can/will be able to vote & rank (https://data.world or your own GitHub repo/Rmd Notebook or Jupyter notebook)
- Learners will build their Data Science portfolio/projects that they were working on together with a mentor from R4DS community
