# TidyWeek
Repo dedicated to Mentorship pilot / TidyWeek <br>

hashtag: #TidyWeek 

A repo dedicated to a #makeovermonday style weekly projects as result of collaboration between students and mentors @ R4DS community.

![R for Data Science online learning community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidyweek/blob/master/rest/31736571%20(1).png) 

# Project Outline
- Regular/weekly projects as output of the mentor-student partnership during a week 
- Train & go through full Data Science cycle/process capturing transformation from raw, messy real-world dataset into tidy form and the output/model, visualization or final document/published via RPubs or as Jupyter notebook via GitHub
- More on #MakeoverMonday here (for those that are not yet familiar with it): http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk
- Share your work via Twitter and other social networks with #TidyWeek (as for the name & hashtag of the project + TidyWeek also because the students will have to “tidy” the messy/real-world dataset first and will have a week to create the output from the given dataset via RPubs document or a Jupyter notebook published on GitHub with the help/oversight of the mentor) 
- Others can/will be able to vote & rank (https://data.world, http://rpubs.com, or )
- Students will build their Data Science portfolio/projects that they were working on together with a mentor from R4DS community

# Tidy data 
[Hadley Wickham's Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) framework  suggests tidy data must have three properties:
* Each variable forms a column.  
* Each observation forms a row.  
* Each type of observational unit forms a table

# Working with Git and Github

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It offers all the functionality of Git, plus a lot of wonderful extra features.  GitHub makes it very easy to share projects across distributed or remote teams and greatly enhances collaboration in collaborative coding and software development. If you're new to Github, learn more through the links below!

## The Git and GitHub Workflow
It's best to start with the notion that using Git and GitHub should be essential parts of your workflow. The point of a workflow is to work in a manner that is both efficient and effective.  Version control will save you countless headaches and adopting it early will allow it to become second nature quickly.

A great read on this is ["Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?"](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)

Here is a great Github fork and pull request video tutorial that goes through a basic workflow in GitHub. 

## Recommended Git resources for beginners: 

These following resources are fantastic comprehensive guides to working with Git and GitHub, and tie in with using R and RStudio.
