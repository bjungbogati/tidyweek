# Welcome to TidyWeek!

TidyWeek is community mentorship program from #R4DS that focuses on using Rstudio, the tidyverse and tidy data principles for analysis.  Our goal is to help students of R4DS by providing an experience with untidy, real world dataset and how to deal with unforseen challenges and obstacles.  The role of the mentor will be mainly to act as a guide for the  phases of a data science process as described by Hadley and Garrett in R4DS.

# Why Should I Join In?

At the end of many of these, you can put forth a portfolio that illustrates how you can apply techniques and skills to solve data science problems.

# So What Do I Do?

Here's a skeleton list to get you started:

* Create a new project in Rstudio.
* Download & Import data into that project
* Explore & Tidy the Data.
* Select an indicator from the dataset for analysis
* Conduct your analysis (comparison, forecast, whatever!)
* Create a visualization to accompany/explain your analysis
* Publish your results at https://data.world
* Tweet it to the world with the #TidyWeek hashtag

# What's Data World?

We're going to be using [Data World](https://data.world), and good ol' fashioned twitter as the platforms to share analysis and output.
